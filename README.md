This repository gathers all my data science projects along with the datasets that shaped them. Each project explores a real-world problem through analysis, visualization, and machine learning, following the timeless rhythm of understanding data first and building solutions next.

You’ll find clean notebooks, organized datasets, and clear steps that trace how every insight was carved out. Whether you wish to learn, review, or build upon these works, feel free to wander through the files at your own pace.

If you have suggestions, doubts, or thoughts you wish to share, your voice is always welcome.
